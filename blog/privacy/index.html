                    <p>It is Paygrid's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a
                            href="https://paygrid.me/">https://paygrid.me/</a> (hereinafter, "us", "we", or
                        "https://paygrid.me/"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally
                        identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy
                        policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we
                        use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third
                        parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does
                        not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website, set forth the
                        general rules and policies governing your use of our Website. Depending on your activities when
                        visiting our Website, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>
                    <h4>Website Visitors</h4>
                    <p>Like most website operators, Paygrid collects non-personally-identifying information of the
                        sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Paygrid's purpose
                        in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Paygrid's
                        visitors use its website. From time to time, Paygrid may release non-personally-identifying
                        information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its
                        website.</p>
                    <p>Paygrid also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
                        (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://paygrid.me/ blog
                        posts. Paygrid only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
                    <p>Certain visitors to Paygrid's websites choose to interact with Paygrid in ways that require
                        Paygrid to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
                        Paygrid gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
                        sign up for a blog at https://paygrid.me/ to provide a username and email address.</p>
                    <h4>Security</h4>
                    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of
                        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive
                        to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee
                        its absolute security.</p>
                    <h4>Advertisements</h4>
                    <p>Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set
                        cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an
                        online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
                        information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they
                        believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by
                        Paygrid and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
                    <h4>Links To External Sites</h4>
                    <p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a
                        third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to
                        review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>
                    <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or
                        practices of any third party sites, products or services.</p>
                    <h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
                    <p>Paygrid discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information
                        only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know
                        that information in order to process it on Paygrid's behalf or to provide services available
                        at Paygrid's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
                        employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country;
                        by using Paygrid's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
                        Paygrid will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
                        information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as
                        described above, Paygrid discloses potentially personally-identifying and
                        personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
                        governmental request, or when Paygrid believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
                        necessary to protect the property or rights of Paygrid, third parties or the public at large.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are a registered user of https://paygrid.me/ and have supplied your email address,
                        Paygrid may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your
                        feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Paygrid and our products. We
                        primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type
                        of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of
                        our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or
                        respond to your request or to help us support other users. Paygrid takes all measures
                        reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction
                        of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
                    <h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>
                    <p>Paygrid may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. Paygrid may
                        display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Paygrid does not disclose
                        your personally-identifying information.</p>
                    <h4>Cookies</h4>
                    <p>To enrich and perfect your online experience, Paygrid uses "Cookies", similar technologies and
                        services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store
                        your preferences on your computer.</p>
                    <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the
                        visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Paygrid uses cookies
                        to help Paygrid identify and track visitors, their usage of https://paygrid.me/, and their
                        website access preferences. Paygrid visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
                        computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Paygrid's websites, with
                        the drawback that certain features of Paygrid's websites may not function properly without
                        the aid of cookies.</p>
                    <p>By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby
                        acknowledge and agree to Paygrid's use of cookies.</p>
                    <h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
                    <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Paygrid may change its Privacy Policy from time
                        to time, and in Paygrid's sole discretion. Paygrid encourages visitors to frequently check
                        this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any
                        change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
